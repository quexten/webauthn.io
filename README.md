## About

This is the source code for [webauthn.io](https://webauthn.io), a demonstration of the Web Authentication specification, or WebAuthn.

This server provides a simple reference implementation of how to add WebAuthn to an application using the [`quexten/webauthn`](https://github.com/quexten/webauthn) Go library.

## Installation

### Using Docker

The easiest way to start a local instance of webauthn.io is to use the image on Docker Hub:

```
docker run --rm -p 9005:9005 duolabs/webauthn.io
```

To run a local instance of webauthn.io in a Docker container, start by building the container image:

```
docker build -t webauthn.io .
```

Then, run the container, exposing port 9005:

```
docker run --rm -p 9005:9005 webauthn.io
```

After the container launches, you can navigate to localhost:9005 to see the application.

### Building from Source

To get started using a local instance of webauthn.io, first download the source code using:

```
go get github.com/quexten/webauthn.io
```

Then, edit `config.json` as needed.

Finally, build and run the application with `go build; ./webauthn.io`)
